## Introduction

The field of Developer Advocacy is growing at a tremendous rate and with that growth comes a wealth of new thought leaders and communities. In this blog post, I'm going to introduce you to the 7 DevRel communities and leaders that have made the biggest impact on my journey. 

### **1. Community Club**

[Community Club](https://www.community.club/) is a quickly growing community of community builders that provides a huge range of resources to new and seasoned community managers alike. At Community Club you can expect to find:

- A large content library with blogs, talks, and podcasts
- Regular AMA Sessions
- Weekly newsletters
- Updated list of tools and software
- Job Board

Community Club also provides a comprehensive career change program for aspiring community managers called [C School](https://www.community.club/c-school). 

### **2. DevRel Collective**

Next up comes [DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun/). This is a great community for any aspiring Developer Advocate and to my knowledge was one of the first established communities for DevRel. DevRel collective is an exclusive community of DevRel practitioners that exists to facilitate sharing information, resources, and encouragement among the Developer Relations community.

### **3. Mary Thengvall**

[Mary Thengvall](https://twitter.com/mary_grace) is Director of Developer Relations at [Camunda ](https://camunda.com/) as well as the writer of ["The Business Value of Developer Relations: How and Why Technical Communities Are Key To Your Success"](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Value-Developer-Relations-Communities/dp/1484237471/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=persea-20&linkId=e4a6e9164220ac63f4f807643935dd27). I first learned about Mary's work through reading her blog post comparing Developer Advocates to Avocado's and have always enjoyed staying up to date with her work. 

### **4. Aaron Aldrich**

[Aaron Aldritch](https://twitter.com/crayzeigh) is a Developer Advocate at Launch Darkly that advocates for conversations regarding mental health in tech. I was able to see Aaron speak in person at DevOps Days 2019 and the content on mental health spoke very deeply to me and my personal struggles. Ever since then I've always stayed up to date with Aaron's content. 

### **5. Orbit Community Discord**

[Orbit ](https://orbit.love/)not only offers a really interesting platform for measuring the health of your community but also a vibrant and active DevRel community hosted on Discord. In this community, you are free to talk about the Orbit Model/Platform and how it correlates to your community goals, or you can just hang out and talk about anything on your mind. 

## Conclusion

Know a community you think I should know about? Shoot me a [Tweet ](https://www.twitter.com/james_bohrman)and let me know! This is a rapidly growing ecosystem and although I'd love to keep up with everything all the time, sometimes that's not easy ðŸ˜….
